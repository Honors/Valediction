\section*{Valediction}

Ms Hutson, Deacon Iannarino, Mr Urquhart, faculty, parents, friends and fellow
classmates, I welcome you. And at this, the day on which we celebrate our
graduation, I say goodbye. As we the class of two thousand fourteen bid our
loving mother farewell, we turn our sights to new endeavors and begin to select
for ourselves a new home in the world.

Our graduation from high school marks a time of many and wonderful changes in
our lives. Of the many changes which might mark a young person's life, none can
match the distinction held by his passage into adulthood, the same transition
marked by our celebration today. Our many years of schooling and
extracurriculars, our stress in the face of exams and our anticipation of
college decisions have all come to pass and their consequence now pales in light
of the journey ahead. 

We now enter the world with a new and excellent credential: we can now call
ourselves Watterson graduates. Certainly, graduation is a day of significance
in any young person's life, but we the graduating class of Bishop Watterson
High School are today endowed with something even grander: we now go forth into
the world equipped with a Watterson degree. This degree is the key into college
for many of us, and a workforce-credential for those of us taking different
paths, but more importantly, it is a symbol of our time spent in these halls,
the formative years which we spent in the nurturing environment of Watterson.
