\section*{Valediction}

Ms Hutson, Deacon Iannarino, Mr Urquhart, faculty, parents, friends and fellow
classmates, I welcome you. And at this, the commencement ceremony of the
current year, I say goodbye. As we the class of two thousand fourteen bid our
loving mother farewell, we turn our sights to new endeavors and begin to select
for ourselves a new home in the world.

Our graduation from high school marks a time of many and wonderful changes in
our lives. Of the many changes which might mark a young person's life, none can
match the distinction held by his passage into adulthood. Our many years of
schooling and extracurriculars, our stress in the face of exams and our
anticipation of college decisions have all come to pass.  Their consequence now
pales in light of the journey ahead; together, we now make a grand leap into
our futures. We climb down from this bridge between elementary school and
adulthood, forever altered by the journey. 

High school has been a tremendous odyssey, one as valuable for its journey as
for its eventual conclusion, namely, the graduation which we now commemorate.
